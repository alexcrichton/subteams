# Subteam report: tools 2015-06-10

## Highlights

This was a fairly quiet week for tooling, but progress continues to be made on
various fronts. MSVC continues to be blocked on upgrading LLVM, which has
[run into another segfault][llvm-segfault] and may take some time to investigate
and fix. @nrc made some great progress on tracking performance metrics for the
compiler, and the frontend is looking quite nice! @brson also continues to
rewrite crater in Rust, soon enabling you to test a change against all of
crates.io from home.

Soon nightlies for MSVC will also be available (note that unwinding still does
not work), and shortly thereafter Cargo MSVC-host nightlies will also likely be
available. This support also lends itself nicely to generating MUSL nightlies
as well!
